# Web-Data-Mining-
Two projects from my web data mining course.  It consists of a web scrapper and a few N-Gram Models based off the retrieved text.

First, run the web scrapper to collect text from the HTML documents, as well as to collect PDFs and other dynamic content.  Then, run the N-gram model notebook with the generated output from the web scrapper to see how easily we may predict the next series of words, syllables, subwords, or characters!
